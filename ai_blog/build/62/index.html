      <p class="body text-start"><p>Today&#39;s Appreciative Narrative reading comes from Chapter 2 of&nbsp;Jaqualine Kelm&#39;s book Appreciative Livng about The Poetic Principle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Poetic Principle suggests that no matter what we want to find in a situation, organization, or person, it is in there somewhere. Narrative therapists talk about the idea of lived experience being &ldquo;<em>rich</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;There are a limitless number of things we can notice in any moment, and our choice is fateful. It is the classic example of one thousand people witnessing an accident and finding one thousand different accounts of what happened. Each person is paying attention to something different&mdash;and they see it through their own lens of reality.</p>

<hr />
<p>The implications of this principle are powerful. It may sound simple enough to look for the good, but shifting our automatic habits of seeing and challenging all those present and pre-existing voices and stories can be difficult. As we described earlier, our beliefs and assumptions&nbsp;play an important role in keeping our lives manageable. It would be impossible for us to immediately throw out all our problem-focused beliefs and replace them with AI beliefs. The transition time in changing our underlying thinking provides a buffer for us in maintaining some continuity and stability in our lives. The more steeped in problem-solving we are, the longer it can take.</p>

<hr />
<p>Consider the Poetic Principle as you think back on three things you are grateful for yesterday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could be a phone call...&nbsp;a few minutes of quiet with a cub of fresh coffee... or even the completion of&nbsp;big project.</p>

<hr />
<p>Go ahead and pause here if you need a few more minutes....</p>

<hr />
<p>Now consider your role in each of those events. Be honest about how they came about.</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, what&#39;s one thing you can do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>Maybe sending a text to a loved one, spending 5 minutes&nbsp;in the garden, or practicing a second language.</p>

<hr />
<p>A quote from Henry Miller: The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes&nbsp;a mysterious, awesome, indescribably&nbsp;magnificent world in itself.</p>
