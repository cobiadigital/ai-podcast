      <title>Ep. 6 Weekly Visoning - Jacqueline Kelm - Joy of Appreciative Living </title>
      <link>https://aiblog.cobiadigital.com/94/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&amp;#39;s reading is about the power of weekly visioning from Chapter 10 of The Joy of Appreciative Living by Jaqualine Kelm.&lt;/p&gt;
]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The power of the 5 Principles of Appreciative Inquiry in daily life can particularly be seen when practiced on a daily basis. This is why we make the gratidude list every morning.&amp;nbsp; Jaqualine Kelm in her book The Joy of Appreciative Living suggests another exercise to do weekly.&amp;nbsp; She calls it the &amp;quot;Weekly Visioning&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelm writes, &amp;quot;The purpose of this exercise is to get clear about what joy looks like for you, and to create ideal mental pictures in your mind that act as beacons you can gravitate toward. It also gives you some insight into answering the daily question&amp;quot; (what are you grateful for and what you can do to today to bring you joy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelm suggests getting into a comfortable spot, get your self into a good mood by thinking about something lovely, then start writing about your ideal, most joy filled life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelm writes, &amp;quot;Pretend that a miracle occurred and your perfect, ideal, &amp;shy;joy-&amp;shy;filled life manifested right now before your eyes. Write down every glorious piece you can imagine about what this ideal life looks like at the highest level. You only have fifteen minutes, so you have to keep the vision big. How is your health? Your career? Your relationships? Your home? List the ideas as they stream through your mind. Let your deepest hopes and desires come forth and dream big about your perfect, happy life. Pretend it is really happening now, and feel the joy inside of you as you write.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have time to write for 15 minutes, think now on what your most joy filled life would look like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about who it includes, and what your relationships look like. Think about where you are physically, emotionally, spiritually, and financially. Think about what you are doing on a day to day basis. What keeps you busy?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will pull you in the diretion of that vision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelm writes: Gaining clarity about what you want in the future takes time, even once you have mastered the visualization exercise. It is a gradual process of defining and refining as you go. While it can be hard at first to figure out what you really want in your life, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot better than riding along in the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ep 5. The Poetic Principe - Jackie Stravos - Conversations Worth Having</title>
      <link>https://aiblog.cobiadigital.com/93/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&amp;#39;s reading is about The Poetic Principle of Appreciative Inquiry&amp;nbsp;from Chapter 4&amp;nbsp;of &amp;quot;Conversations Worth Having&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;by Jackie Stravos and Cheri Torres&lt;/p&gt;
]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The poetic principle is one of the five core principles of Appreciative Inquiry.&amp;nbsp; Essentially it says, &amp;quot;Every person, organization, or situation can be seen and understood from many perspectives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her book &amp;quot;Conversations Worth Having,&amp;quot; Jackie Stravos explains how using the poetic principle in conversations can drastically impact how the conversation goes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She writes. &amp;quot;If our beliefs and the stories we make up about people and situations influence how we understand and how we act, then it makes sense to talk about and pay attention to what&amp;rsquo;s working, what&amp;rsquo;s best, and what&amp;rsquo;s possible.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Later she adds, &amp;quot;Which story turns up in a conversation depends on the frame you are using and the questions you ask.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you name three things you are greatful for today, think about how you may use the poetic principle to reframe what may have been perceived as a negative event, may have turned out to be something postiive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purhapse a difficult time in your past has given you resilience... maybe getting caught in a&amp;nbsp;bad traffic jam, gave you time to call and talk to a loved one... What&amp;#39;s something that innitially felt negative, but upon reflection can be reframed as something positive for which you are grateful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;#39;ve named those three things. Can you identify the role you and others played in making them come about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the chapter Jackie tells a story of Daniel who works with troubled youth coming from gangs. One day, instead of focussing on the misbehavior and acting out of the kids, he began seeing how being in the gang had taught these kids valueable life skills that he could cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackie writes: &amp;quot;Daniel realized these kids actually &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; teamwork and leadership skills. They used them to be a tight gang. He just hadn&amp;rsquo;t looked for them. Over time, his questions surfaced skills in each young man, and some of them discovered they were strong leaders. He now saw his job as helping them realize how capable they were and cultivating their strengths to be effective leaders in the community.&amp;nbsp;Over the next year, Daniel&amp;rsquo;s struggle turned into joy as he watched the potential of these kids emerge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold your viewpoint lightly. Make room for new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[  &lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s Appreciative Narritive thought comes from chapter 3 of Jackaline Kelm&amp;#39;s book &amp;quot;The Joy of Appreciative Living.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For good or ill, we are subjective creatures. We shape our entire lives around what we&amp;nbsp;think&amp;nbsp;we see, but the fact is we see what we want to see. Our beliefs and thinking patterns direct our attention toward what we believe is important or enjoyable or interesting to pay attention to, and this process is not going to change anytime soon. The point is to be aware that we are all biased by nature, and that our perspective is just that: one perspective. We need to hold our beliefs and truths open to new information and further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s one thing you are grateful for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be time you spent with a pet... something particular about your home...&amp;nbsp; a phone call with a family member...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a second thing you are grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a third&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think about what role you played in these three things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Kelm&amp;#39;s study participants said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I learned that joy doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be big. Joy can be found in small, daily things. I found joy in floating in a lake with tiny dragonflies landing on my arms. I found joy in having something &amp;shy;super-&amp;shy;yummy planned for dinner, or cuddling with my &amp;shy;three-&amp;shy;year-&amp;shy;old. How blessed I am!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;In Jaqualine Kelm&amp;#39;s book, Appreciative Living she further lays out the constructionist principle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is not experienced in a vacuum. We simultaneously integrate our past and present beliefs as we construct a new reality with others. As we hear over and over from different sources that being responsible is a good way to live, we begin to view that as &amp;quot;truth.&amp;quot; We come to believe that it is better to follow the rules, do what we promise, and adhere to the standards and norms of our society. We carry that truth into our next experience and act accordingly. It is only &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; for us, from our relative perspective and framework of understanding. It will be viewed differently by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s one thing you are grateful for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be a conversation you had... a few moments of walking in the sun... a particular feeling...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name another thing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name a third...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now think about what role you played in these three things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be ride a bike, bake cookies, play some music...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own life is the instrument with which we experiment with truth13. ~Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stravos Constructionist Conversations Principle</title>
      <link>https://aiblog.cobiadigital.com/18/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&amp;#39;s reading is about The Poetic Principle of Appreciative Inquiry&lt;p&gt;]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s Appreciative Narrative moment comes from Chapter 4 of Conversations worth Having by Jacky Stravos and Cherri Torres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Driving Your Conversations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appreciative Inquiry teaches human interactions rest on a set of five principles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the Constructionist Principle: Understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and ultimately our social reality are created through language and in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: What we believe to be true is informed by and evolves through conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;If the way we talk together influences understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and teams, departments, and organizations (Constructionist Principle), then it makes sense to hold our beliefs lightly and to ask questions and make room for both new knowledge and new meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think back on yesterday and name three things you are grateful for?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you have a great conversation&amp;hellip; an interpersonal connection&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; a moment of joy&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pause the show if you need more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think back on what the role you played in&amp;nbsp; making these moments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally: What&amp;rsquo;s one thing you could do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be playing an instrument, heading to the gym, or even just turning on your favorite song and really dancing to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stravros writes: A meaningful and successful life comes from following your passions and heart, acting from strengths, and using creative thinking to inspire possibility. Therefore, talk about and inspire passion, discover strengths, and make room for creative potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A reading from The Constructionist Principle by Jaqueline Kelm</title>
      <link>https://aiblog.cobiadigital.com/6/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is the Appreciative Narrative Daily Moment. Today&amp;#39;s reading is about The Poetic Principle of Appreciative Inquiry&lt;p&gt;]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s Appreciative Narrative moment comes from Chapter 2 of The Joy of Appreciative Living by Jacqueline Kelm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp; Appreciative Inquiry, the first principle is the Constructionist Principle; its essential idea is that we continuously create or construct stories about what is happening in our lives. The reality we experience is completely subjective, and it is seen through the unique lenses and filters through which we view the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Branch Cabell said &amp;ldquo;The optimist proclaims we live in the best of all possible worlds, and the pessimist fears this is true.&amp;rdquo; What world do you live in?&amp;nbsp; A better question may be: what world do you&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to live in?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think back on yesterday and name three things you are grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a conversation&amp;hellip; a moment of success&amp;hellip; a moment of joy...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to pause&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was your role in making these moments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally:&amp;nbsp;What&amp;rsquo;s one thing you could do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be lunch with a friend, a walk around the block, curling up with a good book&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote from one of Jaqualine Kelm&amp;rsquo;s study participants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The possibilities for framing a day are endless. If we don&amp;rsquo;t make a conscious effort to decide... if we leave it up to the winds... it&amp;rsquo;s like seaweed in the ocean. It goes wherever the current takes it. We need to make conscious choices and deliberately frame our day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
