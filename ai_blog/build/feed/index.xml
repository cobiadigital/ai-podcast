&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp; Appreciative Inquiry, the first principle is the Constructionist Principle; its essential idea is that we continuously create or construct stories about what is happening in our lives. The reality we experience is completely subjective, and it is seen through the unique lenses and filters through which we view the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;James Branch Cabell said &amp;ldquo;The optimist proclaims we live in the best of all possible worlds, and the pessimist fears this is true.&amp;rdquo; What world do you live in?&amp;nbsp; A better question may be: what world do you&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to live in?&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Think back on yesterday and name three things you are grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a conversation&amp;hellip; a moment of success&amp;hellip; a moment of joy...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to pause&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;What was your role in making these moments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Finally:&amp;nbsp;What&amp;rsquo;s one thing you could do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;This could be lunch with a friend, a walk around the block, curling up with a good book&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Quote from one of Jaqualine Kelm&amp;rsquo;s study participants:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The possibilities for framing a day are endless. If we don&amp;rsquo;t make a conscious effort to decide... if we leave it up to the winds... it&amp;rsquo;s like seaweed in the ocean. It goes wherever the current takes it. We need to make conscious choices and deliberately frame our day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Driving Your Conversations?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Appreciative Inquiry teaches human interactions rest on a set of five principles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the Constructionist Principle: Understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and ultimately our social reality are created through language and in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: What we believe to be true is informed by and evolves through conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;If the way we talk together influences understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and teams, departments, and organizations (Constructionist Principle), then it makes sense to hold our beliefs lightly and to ask questions and make room for both new knowledge and new meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Think back on yesterday and name three things you are grateful for?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Did you have a great conversation&amp;hellip; an interpersonal connection&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; a moment of joy&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Pause the show if you need more time.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Think back on what the role you played in&amp;nbsp; making these moments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Finally: What&amp;rsquo;s one thing you could do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;This could be playing an instrument, heading to the gym, or even just turning on your favorite song and really dancing to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Stravros writes: A meaningful and successful life comes from following your passions and heart, acting from strengths, and using creative thinking to inspire possibility. Therefore, talk about and inspire passion, discover strengths, and make room for creative potential.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not experienced in a vacuum. We simultaneously integrate our past and present beliefs as we construct a new reality with others. As we hear over and over from different sources that being responsible is a good way to live, we begin to view that as &amp;quot;truth.&amp;quot; We come to believe that it is better to follow the rules, do what we promise, and adhere to the standards and norms of our society. We carry that truth into our next experience and act accordingly. It is only &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot;¬ù for us, from our relative perspective and framework of understanding. It will be viewed differently by others.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s one thing you are grateful for?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a conversation you had... a few moments of walking in the sun... a particular feeling...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Name another thing...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Name a third...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Now think about what role you played in these three things.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;It could be ride a bike, bake cookies, play some music...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Our own life is the instrument with which we experiment with truth13. ~Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&#13;
&lt;p&gt;For good or ill, we are subjective creatures. We shape our entire lives around what we&amp;nbsp;think&amp;nbsp;we see, but the fact is we see what we want to see. Our beliefs and thinking patterns direct our attention toward what we believe is important or enjoyable or interesting to pay attention to, and this process is not going to change anytime soon. The point is to be aware that we are all biased by nature, and that our perspective is just that: one perspective. We need to hold our beliefs and truths open to new information and further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s one thing you are grateful for?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;It could be time you spent with a pet... something particular about your home...&amp;nbsp; a phone call with a family member...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a second thing you are grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Now a third&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Now think about what role you played in these three things.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;One of Kelm&amp;#39;s study participants said:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I learned that joy doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be big. Joy can be found in small, daily things. I found joy in floating in a lake with tiny dragonflies landing on my arms. I found joy in having something &amp;shy;super-&amp;shy;yummy planned for dinner, or cuddling with my &amp;shy;three-&amp;shy;year-&amp;shy;old. How blessed I am!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Poetic Principle suggests that no matter what we want to find in a situation, organization, or person, it is in there somewhere. Narrative therapists talk about the idea of lived experience being &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;There are a limitless number of things we can notice in any moment, and our choice is fateful. It is the classic example of one thousand people witnessing an accident and finding one thousand different accounts of what happened. Each person is paying attention to something different&amp;mdash;and they see it through their own lens of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this principle are powerful. It may sound simple enough to look for the good, but shifting our automatic habits of seeing and challenging all those present and pre-existing voices and stories can be difficult. As we described earlier, our beliefs and assumptions&amp;nbsp;play an important role in keeping our lives manageable. It would be impossible for us to immediately throw out all our problem-focused beliefs and replace them with AI beliefs. The transition time in changing our underlying thinking provides a buffer for us in maintaining some continuity and stability in our lives. The more steeped in problem-solving we are, the longer it can take.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the Poetic Principle as you think back on three things you are grateful for yesterday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a phone call...&amp;nbsp;a few minutes of quiet with a cub of fresh coffee... or even the completion of&amp;nbsp;big project.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and pause here if you need a few more minutes....&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Now consider your role in each of those events. Be honest about how they came about.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what&amp;#39;s one thing you can do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe sending a text to a loved one, spending 5 minutes&amp;nbsp;in the garden, or practicing a second language.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;A quote from Henry Miller: The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes&amp;nbsp;a mysterious, awesome, indescribably&amp;nbsp;magnificent world in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
